# Animal-Classification

## Overview

Welcome to the Animal Classification project! This repository contains a comprehensive pipeline for classifying animals using machine learning techniques. Our goal is to develop an efficient and accurate system that can identify various animal species based on images. This project can be used for educational purposes, wildlife monitoring, biodiversity studies, and more.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the training process.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implementation of state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet, VGG.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes pre-trained models to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
- **Custom Training**: Allows fine-tuning of models on specific datasets.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for performance evaluation.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing training progress, model performance, and predictions.
- **Deployment**: Scripts for deploying the trained model as a web service.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Flask (for deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animal-classification.git
   cd animal-classification
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your image dataset in the `data/` directory. Ensure the data is organized in subdirectories named after the classes (e.g., `data/lions`, `data/tigers`).

2. **Training**: Run the training script with your desired parameters:
   ```bash
   python train.py --model resnet --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on a test dataset:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model resnet --weights path_to_weights.h5
   ```

4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new images:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg --model resnet --weights path_to_weights.h5
   ```

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web service:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
